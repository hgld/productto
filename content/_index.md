      - title: Get introduced
        content: >-
          Each event starts at 6.30pm sharp with an introduction by each facilitator. This is the most important part of the evening as it will help you understand the topic their group will be discussing and why it's important to them.

      - title: Choose your group
        content: >-
          After the intros, you'll choose a discussion group to join. This isn't a passive keynote where you sit back and listen. You'll be expected to share your knowledge and experience in the group discussion.

      - title: Wrap up
        content: >-
          The discussion groups will wrap up at 8pm, however there's always an opportunity to mingle afterwards. If you've felt inspired by the evening then we encourage you to consider leading a group in the future.

      - question: Do you have a calendar for upcoming events?
        answer: >-
          We don't have a public calendar - however ProductTO events always happen on the fourth Thursday of the month so you can always predict when the next event. The best way to keep up to date on upcoming events is to be on our mailing list when you [apply to join](/join).
      - question: Why hasn't my application been approved yet?
        answer: >-
          We try to get through new applications once a month, however we're also a volunteer team with other jobs and commitments.
          Do feel free to get in touch with one of the co-organizers on the [Product People Slack](https://productpeople.org/) if you'd like an update.
      - question: Is there a Slack group for ProductTO?
        answer: >-
          ProductTO doesn't have a Slack group however we thoroughly recommend [ProductPeople.org](https://productpeople.org/) as a way of continuing the conversation outside of our events.
