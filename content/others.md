  Due to the format of the event – small-group discussions to share problems and learnings from practising Product Managers – we accept applications solely from those with direct experience.

We see many applications from developers, design/UX specialists, MBAs and people of all walks looking to break into Product Management as a career. We always welcome [future applications](/join) from those that have secured a role, and in the interim we highly recommend the [ProductTank Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank_Toronto/) and the [Toronto Product Management Association (TPMA)](https://tpma.ca/) as a more open forum for general product learning.
